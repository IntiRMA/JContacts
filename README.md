## Overview

Originally this was an educational project. It was the intention of this project to unite many different components,
such as databases, to achieve the greatest possible studying success within one single application. Please note that this
application is still in developing and should be used carefully.

In the current state, this application contains all basic features for managing contacts. The single contacts will stored in a local standalone database. Moreover, it's possible to store, edit, export and delete single contacts. In future versions there will be a search function, to extract single contacts from database by tags. Also, there will be multi language support, at the moment for english, french and german.
